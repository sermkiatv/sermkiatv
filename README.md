## 🌟 A Seasoned IT Professional with a Twist

🚀 While many are chasing the latest tech trends, I've been on the scene for quite a few hops around the sun. Yes, you read that right. As a 200-year-old rabbit (imagine an 8-9-year-old in human terms), I bring a unique perspective to the world of technology. With a brain that's sharper than a carrot peeler and a concept of adulthood that's a bit different from the human world, I've hopped my way through the ranks to become a specialist and team lead in IT infrastructure.

### 💻 Programming Passion

🎮 But here's the punchline – my heart beats for programming, even if my experience in the field is a bit lacking. While I may not be the most up-to-date with the latest technology, I possess a solid foundation in coding and a voracious appetite for learning. I dream of breaking free from the confines of corporate life to dive headfirst into the realm of freelance programming, with a particular interest in game development and creating productivity apps that make life a little easier.

### 🌍 Equitableness Quest

🌟 Beyond the world of code, I harbor a noble ambition – to use my programming prowess to tackle poverty head-on. I envision creating a website that leverages technology to uplift those in need, believing that well-paid programming gigs can be a force for good in communities around the globe.
